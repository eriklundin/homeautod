Installation
---------------------------------------

Unfortunately this release of homeautod doesn't include a GUI to add
objects. Use the instructions below or simply add them directly to the
database and restarts homeautod.

Later releases will include a web-based GUI.

Manual installation
---------------------------------------
  * Copy the content from the source tar to /usr/lib/homeautod
  * Create the directory /var/lib/homeautod
  * Copy homeautod.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/
  * Copy homeautod.conf to /etc/homeautod and set it's contents correctly.
  * Run:
    * systemctl enable homeautod.service
    * systemctl daemon-reload
    * systemctl start homeautod.service

Check the syslog that the daemon started:
tail -f /var/log/messages

Database installation/upgrade
---------------------------------------
Create a database for homeautod
mysql -e "CREATE datbase homeautod"

Create a user for homeautod with access to that database
mysql -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON homeautod.* TO 'homeautod'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'changeme'"

Make sure you've edited the settings in /etc/homeautod.conf with the correct database
settings then run /usr/lib/homeautod/upgrade_haddb

If you're upgrading from a previous version you can use upgrade_haddb to update
the schema.
